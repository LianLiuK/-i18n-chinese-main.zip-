Card Verification Code Error
{{if isset($options.isPremium) && $options.isPremium}}

{{/if}}
Please try a different card.
The verification code you entered does not match the code that your bank has on record for the credit/debit card you used.

The ${{$d.total}} account registration fee that you just attempted to pay will appear on your credit card account as an "pending" charge, but the charge has been automatically voided and will not be collected.

Option 1: Double-check the card verification code and try again
Option 2: Use a different card
{{if isset($options.bookstore) && $options.bookstore}} {{/if}} Try Again
To pay the registration fee later, return to the {{$options.prodname}} home page and log-in with the user name and password you just created for your account. You will arrive automatically at the account payment page where you can try making the credit/debit card payment again.

{{else}}
System Error
There was an error on our server while processing your payment.
Your card has not been charged.
Please try again later.
